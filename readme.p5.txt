Even in your hobbies, has there not always been some secret attraction 
which the others are curiously ignorant of--something, not to be identified
with, but always on the verge of breaking through, the smell of cut wood 
in the workshop or the clap-clap of water against the boat's side? Are not
all lifelong friendships born at the moment when at last you meet another 
human being who has some inkling (but faint and uncertain even in the best) 
of that something which you were born desiring, and which, beneath the flux 
of other desires and in all the momentary silences between the louder 
passions, night and day, year by year, from childhood to old age, you are 
looking for, watching for, listening for? You have never had it. All the things 
that have ever deeply possessed your soul have been but hints of it--tantalizing
glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they 
caught your ear. But if it should really become manifest--if there ever came 
an echo that did not die away but swelled into the sound itself--you would know 
it. Beyond all possibility of doubt you would say 'Here at last is the thing I 
was made for.' We cannot tell each other about it. It is the secret signature 
of each soul, the incommunicable and unappeasable want, the things we desired 
before we met our wives or made our friends or chose our work, and which we shall 
still desire on our deathbeds, when the mind no longer knows wife or friend or 
work. While we are, this is. If we lose this, we lose all....

It is from this point of view that we can understand hell in its aspect of 
privation. All your life an unattainable ecstasy has hovered just beyond the 
grasp of your consciousness. The day is coming when you will wake to find, 
beyond all hope, that you have attained it, or else, that it was within your 
reach and you have lost it forever.

--C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain (from the Chapter on "Heaven")
